# WELCOME TO THE PYGIT++ ERA!!
(WARNING: This program is not even in alpha; much of it is still incomplete work)

## WHAT'S THIS?
**Pygit++ can be definde as simple as just as a better user
experience for git**


## Get this buggy thing going

#### First clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thelibertti/pygit-
```

#### install the dependencies with

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Add it to your path!!
look for your shell configuration file such as '.zshrc' or '.bashrc'
in your home directory and open it, and add the next line:
```bash
alias pygit="python [path_to_the_pygit++_dir]/main.py"
```

(Make sure to change the path to where main.py is 
located and remove the square brackets)

And that’s it, you’re good to go!

## HELP?

##### Try ```pigit -h``` or see the DOCS
