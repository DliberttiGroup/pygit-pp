# Future commands:
- ### -s, --show Status: Being work on

**This command will display full information about
the current git repository for example things like a full
list of commits and a full list of files that are being
tracked or not plus their current status always keeping a clean
interface plus some really cool icons**

Some things that could be into the information displayed are:

- a list of the lastest commits
- blame for those commits
- time for the commits
- status of the repository
- all the files that are in the repository (plus their status)

among other important information abour the repository

- ### -p, --push Status: Pending

**A full optimization of the push procces where the user
has to pretty much just commit and pygit should be able to complete
do the rest of the work for the user always keeping a clean UX**


- ### -a, -add Status: Implemented ✅
**A interactive way to add files to the index of the repo**


- ### -c, --commit Status: Implemented ✅ 
**A better way to commit your work for example now you can select
what is your commit about (for example you added somethin '[ADD]' 
or you modified somethings '[MODIFY]') and this will be added as a 
preffix to your commit automatically plus some other extra functions
such a counter that will tell when your commit is either too long 
or if you are just in the reccomended size of a commit**
